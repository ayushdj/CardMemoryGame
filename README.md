# Card Memory Game
This is a project I worked on in the first semester of my MSCS-Align program.
It is a card matching/memory game. If the user selects two cards that are the same
as one another, they will be removed from the game. If not, the user has about
3 seconds to memorize the locations and kinds of each card, after which the cards
will flip back on their side such that the user has another shot. Enjoy the game!
